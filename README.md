# caloriesCalc

Just a calculator in (almost) pure JavaScript that will save you about 4 minutes once in your life.

caloriesCalc is a simple calculator that will define your daily calories intake depending on some values; weight, height, age, sex, somatic body type and some other variables.
After some time I've decided to add protein/carbs/fat calculator that will tell you how much of it you should eat everyday to stay healthy- just so you know, cutting fat and sugar to 0 isn't the best solution in long-term diet.

Last thing: it works with metric system only. Sorry Myanmar, Liberia and USA.
